    "For evaluation you'll use the [TREC Eval](https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval) utility, provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology of the United States. TREC Eval is the de facto standard way to compute Information Retrieval measures and is frequently referenced in scientific papers.\n",

    "The TREC Eval utility can be downloaded and compiled as follows:\n",

    "    git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git\n",

    "TREC Eval computes evaluation scores given two files: ground-truth information regarding relevant documents, named *query relevance* or *qrel*, and a ranking of documents for a set of queries, referred to as a *run*. The *qrel* will be supplied by us and should not be changed. For every retrieval model (or combinations thereof) you will generate a run of the top-1000 documents for every query. The format of the *run* file is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $query_identifier Q0 $document_identifier $rank_of_document_for_query $query_document_similarity $run_identifier\n",
    "    \n",
    "where\n",
    "   * `$query_identifier` is the unique identifier corresponding to a query (usually this follows a sequential numbering).\n",
    "   * `Q0` is a legacy field that you can ignore.\n",
    "   * `$document_identifier` corresponds to the unique identifier of a document (e.g., APXXXXXXX where AP denotes the collection and the Xs correspond to a unique numerical identifier).\n",
    "   * `$rank_of_document_for_query` denotes the rank of the document for the particular query. This field is ignored by TREC Eval and is only maintained for legacy support. The ranks are computed by TREC Eval itself using the `$query_document_similarity` field (see next). However, it remains good practice to correctly compute this field.\n",
    "   * `$query_document_similarity` is a score indicating the similarity between query and document where a higher score denotes greater similarity.\n",
    "   * `$run_identifier` is an identifier of the run. This field is for your own convenience and has no purpose beyond bookkeeping.\n",
    "   \n",
    "For example, say we have two queries: `Q1` and `Q2` and we rank three documents (`DOC1`, `DOC2`, `DOC3`). For query `Q1`, we find the following similarity scores `score(Q1, DOC1) = 1.0`, `score(Q1, DOC2) = 0.5`, `score(Q1, DOC3) = 0.75`; and for `Q2`: `score(Q2, DOC1) = -0.1`, `score(Q2, DOC2) = 1.25`, `score(Q1, DOC3) = 0.0`.
